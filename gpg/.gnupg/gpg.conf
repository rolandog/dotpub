# Options for gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.12
# See the 'OPTIONS' section of 'man gpg'
#


#----------------------------------
# Default Private Key
#----------------------------------

# Use name as the default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the
# default key is the first key found in the secret keyring. Note that -u or
# --local-user overrides this option. This option may be given multiple times.
# In this case, the last key for which a secret key is available is used. If
# there is no secret key available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will
# not emit an error message but continue as if this option wasn't given.
# TODO: set 'default-key'
#default-key 0x0123456789ABCDEF

# Use name as default recipient if option --recipient is not used and don't ask
# if this is a valid one. name must be non-empty.
#default-recipient name

# Use the default key as default recipient if option --recipient is not used and
# don't ask if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from the
# secret keyring or the one set with --default-key.
default-recipient-self

# Reset --default-recipient and --default-recipient-self.
#no-default-recipient


#----------------------------------
# List Options
#----------------------------------

# This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when listing
# keys and signatures.
#
# That is, --list-keys, --check-signatures, --list-public-keys,
# --list-secret-keys, and the --edit-key functions.
#
# Options can be prepended with a no- (after the two dashes) to give the
# opposite meaning. The options are:
#   show-photos
#       Causes --list-keys, --check-signatures, --list-public-keys, and
#       --list-secret-keys to display any photo IDs attached to the key.
#       Defaults to no. See also --photo-viewer. Does not work with
#       --with-colons: see --attribute-fd for the appropriate way to get photo
#       data for scripts and other frontends.
#   show-usage
#       Show usage information for keys and subkeys in the standard key listing.
#       This is a list of letters indicating the allowed usage for a key
#       (E=encryption, S=signing, C=certification, A=authentication). Defaults
#       to yes.
#   show-policy-urls
#       Show policy URLs in the --check-signatures listings. Defaults to no.
#   show-notations, show-std-notations, show-user-notations
#       Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations in the
#       --check-signatures listings. Defaults to no.
#   show-keyserver-urls
#       Show any preferred keyserver URL in the --check-signatures listings.
#       Defaults to no.
#   show-uid-validity
#       Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key listings.
#       Defaults to yes.
#   show-unusable-uids
#       Show revoked and expired user IDs in key listings. Defaults to no.
#   show-unusable-subkeys
#       Show revoked and expired subkeys in key listings. Defaults to no.
#   show-keyring
#       Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show which
#       keyring a given key resides on. Defaults to no.
#   show-sig-expire
#       Show signature expiration dates (if any) during --check-signatures
#       listings. Defaults to no.
#   show-sig-subpackets
#       Include signature subpackets in the key listing. This option can take an
#       optional argument list of the subpackets to list. If no argument is
#       passed, list all subpackets. Defaults to no. This option is only
#       meaningful when using --with-colons along with --check-signatures.
#   show-only-fpr-mbox
#       For each valid user-id which also has a valid mail address print only
#       the fingerprint and the mail address.

#----------------------------------
# Verify Options
#----------------------------------

# This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when
# verifying signatures. Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the
# opposite meaning. The options are:
#   show-photos
#       Display any photo IDs present on the key that issued the signature.
#       Defaults to no. See also --photo-viewer.
#   show-policy-urls
#       Show policy URLs in the signature being verified. Defaults to yes.
#   show-notations, show-std-notations, show-user-notations
#       Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations in the
#       signature being verified. Defaults to IETF standard.
#   show-keyserver-urls
#       Show any preferred keyserver URL in the signature being verified.
#       Defaults to yes.
#   show-uid-validity
#       Display the calculated validity of the user IDs on the key that issued
#       the signature. Defaults to yes.
#   show-unusable-uids
#       Show revoked and expired user IDs during signature verification.
#       Defaults to no.
#   show-primary-uid-only
#       Show only the primary user ID during signature verification. That is all
#       the AKA lines as well as photo Ids are not shown with the signature
#       verification status.
#   pka-lookups
#       Enable PKA lookups to verify sender addresses. Note that PKA is based on
#       DNS, and so enabling this option may disclose information on when and
#       what signatures are verified or to whom data is encrypted. This is
#       similar to the "web bug" described for the --auto-key-retrieve option.
#   pka-trust-increase
#       Raise the trust in a signature to full if the signature passes PKA
#       validation. This option is only meaningful if pka-lookups is set.

#----------------------------------
# Charset Options
#----------------------------------

# Set the name of the native character set. This is used to convert some
# informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note that
# this has nothing to do with the character set of data to be encrypted or
# signed; GnuPG does not recode user-supplied data. If this option is not used,
# the default character set is determined from the current locale. A verbosity
# level of 3 shows the chosen set. Valid values for name are:
#   iso-8859-1
#     This is the Latin 1 set.
#   iso-8859-2
#     The Latin 2 set.
#   iso-8859-15
#     This is currently an alias for the Latin 1 set.
#   koi8-r
#     The usual Russian set (RFC-1489).
#   utf-8
#     Bypass all translations and assume that the OS uses native UTF-8 encoding.
display-charset utf-8

# Assume that command line arguments are given as UTF-8 strings. The default
# (--no-utf8-strings) is to assume that arguments are encoded in the character
# set as specified by --display-charset. These options affect all following
# arguments. Both options may be used multiple times.
utf8-strings


#----------------------------------
# Certification Level
#----------------------------------

# When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level. If this option
# is not specified, the certification level used is set via
# --default-cert-level. See --default-cert-level for information on the specific
# levels and how they are used. --no-ask-cert-level disables this option.
# This option defaults to no.
ask-cert-level
#no-ask-cert-level

# The default to use for the check level when signing a key:
#
#   0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
#   key.
#   1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it but
#   you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is useful for a
#   "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.
#   2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this could mean
#   that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key
#   against a photo ID.
#   3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example, this could
#   mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
#   person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
#   photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
#   name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
#   of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.
#
# Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that: examples.
# In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive" mean
# to you.
# This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).
#default-cert-level 0

# When building the trust database, treat any signatures with a certification
# level below this as invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level 1
# signatures. Note that level 0 "no particular claim" signatures are always
# accepted.
#min-cert-level 2

# Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID) is
# as trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is useful if you
# don't want to keep your secret keys (or one of them) online but still want to
# be able to check the validity of a given recipient's or signator's key.
#trusted-key long key ID


#----------------------------------
# Trust model
#----------------------------------

# Set what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:
#   pgp
#       This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as used in
#       PGP 5.x and later. This is the default trust model when creating a new
#       trust database
#   classic
#       This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2.
#   tofu
#       TOFU stands for Trust On First Use.  In this trust model, the first time
#       a  key  is  seen,  it is memorized.  If later another key with a user id
#       with the same email address is seen, both keys are  marked  as  suspect.
#       In  that  case, the next time either is used, a warning is displayed de‐
#       scribing the conflict, why it might have occurred (either the user  gen‐
#       erated  a new key and failed to cross sign the old and new keys, the key
#       is forgery, or a man-in-the-middle attack is being attempted),  and  the
#       user  is  prompted  to manually confirm the validity of the key in ques‐
#       tion.

#       Because a potential attacker is able to control the  email  address  and
#       thereby  circumvent  the  conflict detection algorithm by using an email
#       address that is similar in appearance to a trusted email address,  when‐
#       ever  a  message  is  verified,  statistics about the number of messages
#       signed with the key are shown.  In this way, a user can easily  identify
#       attacks using fake keys for regular correspondents.

#       When  compared  with  the Web of Trust, TOFU offers significantly weaker
#       security guarantees.  In particular, TOFU only helps ensure  consistency
#       (that  is,  that  the  binding  between  a key and email address doesn't
#       change).  A major advantage of TOFU is that it requires  little  mainte‐
#       nance  to  use correctly.  To use the web of trust properly, you need to
#       actively sign keys and mark users as trusted  introducers.   This  is  a
#       time-consuming  process  and anecdotal evidence suggests that even secu‐
#       rity-conscious users rarely take the time to do this thoroughly and  in‐
#       stead rely on an ad-hoc TOFU process.

#       In  the  TOFU  model, policies are associated with bindings between keys
#       and email addresses (which are extracted from user ids and  normalized).
#       There are five policies, which can be set manually using the --tofu-pol‐
#       icy option.  The default policy can be set using the --tofu-default-pol‐
#       icy option.

#       The  TOFU policies are: auto, good, unknown, bad and ask.  The auto pol‐
#       icy is used by default (unless overridden by --tofu-default-policy)  and
#       marks  a binding as marginally trusted.  The good, unknown and bad poli‐
#       cies mark a binding as fully trusted, as having unknown trust or as hav‐
#       ing  trust  never,  respectively.  The unknown policy is useful for just
#       using TOFU to detect conflicts, but to never assign positive trust to  a
#       binding.   The  final policy, ask prompts the user to indicate the bind‐
#       ing's trust.  If batch mode is enabled (or input is inappropriate in the
#       context), then the user is not prompted and the undefined trust level is
#       returned.
#   tofu+pgp
#       This trust model combines TOFU with the Web of Trust.  This is  done  by
#       computing  the  trust  level  for each model and then taking the maximum
#       trust level where the trust levels are ordered as follows: unknown < un‐
#       defined < marginal < fully < ultimate < expired < never.
#
#       By  setting --tofu-default-policy=unknown, this model can be used to im‐
#       plement the web of trust with TOFU's conflict detection  algorithm,  but
#       without  its  assignment  of positive trust values, which some security-
#       conscious users don't like.

# Set what trust model GnuPG should follow.

# This is dummy option. gpg always requires the agent.
#use-agent


#----------------------------------
# Key retrieval and methods
#----------------------------------

# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option.
# This happens when encrypting to an email address (in the "user@example.com"
# form), and there are no "user@example.com" keys on the local keyring. This
# option takes any number of the mechanisms listed below, in the order they are
# to be tried. Instead of listing the mechanisms as comma delimited arguments,
# the option may also be given several times to add more mechanism. The option
# --no-auto-key-locate or the mechanism "clear" resets the list.
# The default is "local,wkd". 

# Locate the key using the local keyrings. This mechanism allows the user to
# select the order a local key lookup is done. Thus using '--auto-key-locate
# local' is identical to --no-auto-key-locate.
auto-key-locate local

# Locate a key using the Web Key Directory protocol.
# Available since GnuPG 2.1.12
auto-key-locate wkd

# Locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398.
#auto-key-locate cert

# Locate a key using DNS PKA.
#auto-key-locate pka

# Locate a key using DANE, as specified in draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-05.txt.
# Available since GnuPG 2.2.1
#auto-key-locate dane

# Locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using the --keyserver option.
# TODO: is 'auto-key-locate keyserver' safe? possible flooding attack?
#auto-key-locate keyserver

# Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in question for any LDAP
# keyservers to use. If this fails, attempt to locate the key using the PGP
# Universal method of checking 'ldap://keys.(thedomain)'.
#auto-key-locate ldap

# The option --no-auto-key-locate or the mechanism "clear" resets the list. 
#no-auto-key-locate
#auto-key-locate clear

# These options enable or disable the automatic retrieving of keys from a
# keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are not on the local
# keyring. The default is --no-auto-key-retrieve.
#
# The order of methods tried to lookup the key is:
#
# 1. If a preferred keyserver is specified in the signature and the option
# honor-keyserver-url is active (which is not the default), that keyserver is
# tried. Note that the creator of the signature uses the option
# --sig-keyserver-url to specify the preferred keyserver for data signatures.
#
# 2. If the signature has the Signer's UID set (e.g. using --sender while
# creating the signature) a Web Key Directory (WKD) lookup is done.
# This is the default configuration but can be disabled by removing WKD from the
# auto-key-locate list or by using the option --disable-signer-uid.
#
# 3. If the option honor-pka-record is active, the legacy PKA method is used.
#
# 4. If any keyserver is configured and the Issuer Fingerprint is part of the
# signature (since GnuPG 2.1.16), the configured keyservers are tried.
#
# Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible. Keyserver or
# Web Key Directory operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you
# a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have on your
# local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the time when
# you verified the signature.

# Always display long key IDs. Short key IDs can be spoofed.
# Default: short

#----------------------------------
# Key Server Options
#----------------------------------

# This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the
# keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a 'no-' to give the opposite meaning.
# Valid import-options or export-options may be used here as well to apply to
# importing (--recv-key) or exporting (--send-key) a key from a keyserver. While
# not all options are available for all keyserver types, some common options
# are:
#   include-revoked
#       When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are
#       marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that not all keyservers
#       differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such
#       keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do
#       not have cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so turning
#       this option off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked
#       as revoked.
#   include-disabled
#       When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are
#       marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that this option is not used
#       with HKP keyservers.
#   auto-key-retrieve
#       This is an obsolete alias for the option auto-key-retrieve. Please do
#       not use it; it will be removed in future versions..
#   honor-keyserver-url
#       When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred
#       keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to refresh the key
#       from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being
#       verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred
#       keyserver to fetch the key from. Note that this option introduces a "web
#       bug": The creator of the key can see when the keys is refreshed. Thus
#       this option is not enabled by default.
#   honor-pka-record
#       If --auto-key-retrieve is used, and the signature being verified has a
#       PKA record, then use the PKA information to fetch the key. Defaults to
#       "yes".
#   include-subkeys
#      When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets. Note that
#      this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support
#      retrieving keys by subkey id.
#   timeout
#       Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in seconds) to try and
#       perform a keyserver action before giving up. Note that performing
#       multiple actions at the same time uses this timeout value per action.
#       For example, when retrieving multiple keys via --receive-keys, the
#       timeout applies separately to each key retrieval, and not to the
#       --receive-keys command as a whole. Defaults to 30 seconds.
#   http-proxy=value
#       This option is deprecated. Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP
#       keyservers. This overrides any proxy defined in `dirmngr.conf'.
#   verbose
#       This option has no more function since GnuPG 2.1. Use the dirmngr
#       configuration options instead.
#   debug
#       This option has no more function since GnuPG 2.1. Use the dirmngr
#       configuration options instead.
#   check-cert
#       This option has no more function since GnuPG 2.1. Use the dirmngr
#       configuration options instead.
#   ca-cert-file
#       This option has no more function since GnuPG 2.1. Use the dirmngr
#       configuration options instead.

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are marked on
# the keyserver as revoked
keyserver-options include-revoked

# When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver
# URL, then disable use of that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from

# Specify how many times the passphrases mangling for symmetric encryption is
# repeated. This value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive. The
# default is inquired from gpg-agent. Note that not all values in the

# round up to the nearest legal value. This option is only meaningful if
# --s2k-mode is set to the default of 3.

# Compliance options
#----------------------------------

# These options control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only one of these options
# may be active at a time. Note that the default setting of this is nearly
# always the correct one. See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS
# section below before using one of these options.

# Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP behavior (see
# --openpgp), but with some additional workarounds for common compatibility
# problems in different versions of PGP. This is the default option, so it is
# not generally needed, but it may be useful to override a different compliance
# option in the gpg.conf file.
