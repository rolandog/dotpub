# =--default-key name=
# Use name as the default key to sign with.  If this option is not used,
# the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring.  Note
# that =-u= or =--local-user= overrides this option.  This option may be
# given multiple times.  In this case, the last key for which a secret
# key is available is used.  If there is no secret key available for any
# of the specified values, GnuPG will not emit an error message but
# continue as if this option wasn't given.

# =--default-recipient name=
# Use name as default recipient if option =--recipient= is not used and
# don't ask if this is a valid one. name must be non-empty.

#default-recipient name

# =--default-recipient-self=
# Use the default key as default recipient if option =--recipient= is
# not used and don't ask if this is a valid one.  The default key is the
# first one from the secret keyring or the one set with =--default-key=.

# =--no-default-recipient=
# Reset =--default-recipient= and =--default-recipient-self=.  Should

# =--list-options= /=parameters=/
# This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when
# listing keys and signatures (that is, =--list-keys=,
# =--check-signatures=, =--list-public-keys=, =--list-secret-keys=, and
# the =--edit-key= functions).  Options can be prepended with a =no-=
# (after the two dashes) to give the opposite meaning.  The options are:

# - =show-photos= :: Causes =--list-keys=, =--check-signatures=,
#   =--list-public-keys=, and =--list-secret-keys= to display any photo
#   IDs attached to the key.  Defaults to no.  See also
#   =--photo-viewer=.  Does not work with =--with-colons=: see
#   =--attribute-fd= for the appropriate way to get photo data for
#   scripts and other frontends.
# - =show-usage= :: Show usage information for keys and subkeys in the
#   standard key listing.  This is a list of letters indicating the
#   allowed usage for a key ( =E=\=encryption, =S=\=signing,
#   =C=\=certification, =A= \=authentication).  Defaults to yes.
# - =show-policy-urls= :: Show policy URLs in the =--check-signatures=
#   listings.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-notations= :: (=show-std-notations=, =show-user-notations=)
#   Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations in the
#   =--check-signatures= listings.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-keyserver-urls= :: Show any preferred keyserver URL in the
#   =--check-signatures= listings.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-uid-validity= :: Display the calculated validity of user IDs
#   during key listings.  Defaults to yes.
# - =show-unusable-uids= :: Show revoked and expired user IDs in key
#   listings.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-unusable-subkeys= :: Show revoked and expired subkeys in key
#   listings.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-keyring= :: Display the keyring name at the head of key
#   listings to show which keyring a given key resides on.  Defaults to
#   no.
# - =show-sig-expire= :: Show signature expiration dates (if any) during
#   =--check-signatures= listings.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-sig-subpackets= :: Include signature subpackets in the key
#   listing.  This option can take an optional argument list of the
#   subpackets to list.  If no argument is passed, list all
#   subpackets.  Defaults to no.  This option is only meaningful when
#   using =--with-colons= along with =--check-signatures=.
# - =show-only-fpr-mbox= :: For each user-id which has a valid mail
#   address print only the fingerprint followed by the mail address.
# - =sort-sigs= :: With =--list-sigs= and =--check-sigs= sort the signatures
#   by keyID and creation time to make it easier to view the history of
#   these signatures. The self-signature is also listed before other
#   signatures. Defaults to yes.

# =--verify-options= /=parameters=/
# This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when
# verifying signatures.  Options can be prepended with a =no-= to give
# the opposite meaning.  The options are:

# - =show-photos= :: Display any photo IDs present on the key that
#   issued the signature.  Defaults to no.  See also =--photo-viewer=.
# - =show-policy-urls= :: Show policy URLs in the signature being
#   verified.  Defaults to yes.
# - =show-notations= :: (=show-std-notations=, =show-user-notations=)
#   Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations in the
#   signature being verified.  Defaults to IETF standard.
# - =show-keyserver-urls= :: Show any preferred keyserver URL in the
#   signature being verified.  Defaults to yes.
# - =show-uid-validity= :: Display the calculated validity of the user
#   IDs on the key that issued the signature.  Defaults to yes.
# - =show-unusable-uids= :: Show revoked and expired user IDs during
#   signature verification.  Defaults to no.
# - =show-primary-uid-only= :: Show only the primary user ID during
#   signature verification.  That is all the AKA lines as well as photo
#   Ids are not shown with the signature verification status.
# - =pka-lookups= :: (Deprecated?) Enable PKA lookups to verify sender
#   addresses.  Note that PKA is based on DNS, and so enabling this
#   option may disclose information on when and what signatures are
#   verified or to whom data is encrypted.  This is similar to the "web
#   bug" described for the auto-key-retrieve feature.
# - =pka-trust-increase= :: (Deprecated?) Raise the trust in a signature
#   to full if the signature passes PKA validation.  This option is only
#   meaningful if =pka-lookups= is set.

# =--photo-viewer= /=string=/
# This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID.  =%i=
# will be expanded to a filename containing the photo.  =%I= does the
# same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer exits.
# Other flags are =%k= for the key ID, =%K= for the long key ID, =%f=
# for the key fingerprint, =%t= for the extension of the image type
# (e.g. "jpg"), =%T= for the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg"),
# =%v= for the single-character calculated validity of the image being
# viewed (e.g. "f"), =%V= for the calculated validity as a string
# (e.g. "full"), =%U= for a base32 encoded hash of the user ID, and =%%=
# for an actual percent sign.  If neither =%i= or =%I= are present, then
# the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input.

# The default viewer is =xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k'
# STDIN=.  Note that if your image viewer program is not secure, then
# executing it from GnuPG does not make it secure.
