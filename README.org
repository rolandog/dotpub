One of the common things that brings programmers together is dealing
with "dotfiles"---configuration files that often begin with a "=.="
character.

This repository is meant to be cloned inside =~.dotfiles/.pub/=, and
from that directory, package's dotfiles are meant to be installed by
running =stow PACKAGE=.

* Downloading dotfiles
This repository is meant to be cloned inside =~.dotfiles/.pub/=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code :eval never :dir ~ :wrap SRC text
  mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles/.pub
  git clone https://git.sr.ht/~rolandog/dotpub ~/.dotfiles/.pub
  cd ~/.dotfiles/.pub
#+END_SRC

* Installing dotfiles
After cloning, one can "install" the dotfiles of a certain =package=
by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code :eval never :dir ~ :wrap SRC text
  stow PACKAGE
#+END_SRC

* Pushing local changes
The first time we want to push additional changes back:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code :eval never :dir ~ :wrap SRC text
  git remote add origin git@git.sr.ht:~rolandog/dotpub
  git push --set-upstream origin main
#+END_SRC
