# This is the ssh client user-specific configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

### Config parsing order

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.


### Debian 

# Note that the Debian openssh-client package sets several options as standard in
# /etc/ssh/ssh_config which are not the default in ssh(1):

#   Include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*.conf
#   SendEnv LANG LC_*
#   HashKnownHosts yes
#   GSSAPIAuthentication yes

# /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*.conf files are included at the start of the system-wide
# configuration file, so options set there will override those in /etc/ssh/ssh_config.


### defaults
# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.
